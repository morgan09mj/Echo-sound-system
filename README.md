# Echo-sound-system
The goal is to implement the echo sounder system.

## Description :
In this section, we write a program that reads our voice from the microphone of our system and adds the desired echo to it and sends it to the speaker of our system, make sure that the design of this program must be such that it can be used in the application. Real time use it and not just with a pre-recorded file.
Note: 1 To solve this question, it is better to install the desired libraries on our system.
Note: 2 For this, we calculate the echo by taking into account the amplitude and delay of the system's shock response, and then canalize it with the input sound and produce the result.
